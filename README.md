The AICTE-IBM internship program offered an exciting opportunity to delve into the world of frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. During the internship, we embarked on a challenging project to create an Amazon clone. With the guidance of experienced mentors, we honed our skills in designing and structuring web pages using HTML, enhancing the visual appeal with CSS, and adding interactive functionalities through JavaScript. Through this hands-on experience, we gained practical knowledge in building responsive and user-friendly web interfaces, replicating the key features and functionalities of the popular e-commerce platform. This internship provided a solid foundation for our future endeavors in frontend development.
